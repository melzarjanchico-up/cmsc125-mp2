# `cmsc125-mp2`: Lab Exercise 2

Implement the FCFS, SJF, SRPT, Priority and Round-robin scheduling. Sample data is given to you (please refer to process1.txt and process2.txt).

- For FCFS and SJF, assume all processes arrived at time 0 in that order.
- For SRPT, consider the arrival time of each processes.
- For Priority, assume that lower-value priorities have higher priorities (that means 0 is the
highest priority).
- For round-robin scheduling, assume a uniform time slice of 4 millisecond.

Display the waiting time for each process for every algorithm, as well as their average computing time. Also, perform an algorithm evaluation, based on the datasets given to you.
